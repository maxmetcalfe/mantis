# mantis

This repo contains a set of Python web scrapers to gather race information from running races.

## UltraSignup / Entrants

This script runs daily to gather the count of entrants for a set list of races from UltraSignup.com. The resulting counts are sent to a list of email recipients.


## Comrades / Results

This script scrapes the results from a Comrades Marathon race for a particular year.

You can see an archive of the scraped data (so far) [here](https://maxmetcalfe.github.io/comrades-results/).

For all issues with the scripts or the data, please file an issue.
