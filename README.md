# mantis

This repo contains a set of Python web scrapers to gather race information from running races.

## UltraSignup / Entrants

This script runs daily to gather the count of entrants for a set list of races from UltraSignup.com. The resulting counts are sent to a list of email recipients.


## Comrades / Results

This script scrapes the results from a Comrades Marathon race for a particular year. It is currently up and running on a Jenkins instance and can be used to fetch data for future years.

I will post a location of historical result pulls soon.

For all issues or access to the data, please file an issue.
